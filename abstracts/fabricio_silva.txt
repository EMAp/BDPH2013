.. title: Cloud Computing Technologies for Genomic Big Data Analysis
.. slug: fabricio_silva



In this talk we will present several cloud computing technologies that are being used for processing large volumes of genomic data. We also intend to present recent trends in cloud computing technologies and discuss how these new technologies can be used to increase throughput and decrease the processing time of genomic pipelines.
